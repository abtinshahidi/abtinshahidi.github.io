In this talk I presented my work on the estimation of the Neutral hydrogen and dark matter bias and the effect of the extended Limber approximation, instead of the usual one. Basically, the main idea is to check whether a common estimator for quantifying deviation of modified gravity from general relativity, holds even under the scale dependent bias. ($bias(k)$)
