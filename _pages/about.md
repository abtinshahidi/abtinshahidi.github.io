My name is Abtin Shahidi and I am a PhD student in Observational extragalactic astrophysics. My focus is on finding galaxies with very old stellar population at relatively high redshift ($z>3$) in very large and multiwavelenght photometric catalogs. I am currently working on the CANDELS and COSMOS multiwavelenght catalogs to extract and infer their physical properties including their age and their star-formation rate. I am also a teaching assistance for various courses in both physics and engineering at the [University of California, Riverside (UCR)](https://www.ucr.edu/). (For more information about type of research in the Astronomy group at UCR, visit the [Astronomy Group at UCR](https://pages.github.com)

I use the photometric and spectroscopic data from largest ground and space based telescopes such as [W. M. Keck Observatory](http://www.keckobservatory.org/), [Subaru Telescope](https://subarutelescope.org/), [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html), [Hubble Space Telescope](http://hubblesite.org/) and hopefully within few years I get the chance to observe with [Thirty Meter Telescope](https://www.tmt.org/), [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/), and [WFIRST](https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

I love traveling, backpacking, swimming, and coding!
