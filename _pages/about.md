My name is Abtin Shahidi, and I am a Ph.D. student in Observational extragalactic astrophysics. I am interested in data-driven approaches to extracting information from multiwavelength photometric catalogs containing missing bands.  I am working on galaxies classification based on their observed/physical properties and directly estimating their physical properties.

 I am currently using the [CANDELS](http://arcoiris.ucolick.org/candels/) and [COSMOS](https://cosmos.astro.caltech.edu/) multiwavelength catalogs, as well as semi-analytical models of galaxy formation to extract and infer galaxies physical properties, including their age and their star-formation rate, as well as constraining their star formation histories. I am also a teaching assistant for various courses in both physics and engineering at [the University of California, Riverside (UCR)](https://www.ucr.edu/). (For more information about the type of research in the Astronomy group at UCR, visit the [Astronomy Group at UCR](https://astro.ucr.edu/) )

I use the photometric and spectroscopic data from the largest ground and space based telescopes such as [W. M. Keck Observatory](http://www.keckobservatory.org/), [Subaru Telescope](https://subarutelescope.org/), [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html), [Hubble Space Telescope](http://hubblesite.org/) and hopefully within few years I get the chance to observe with [Thirty Meter Telescope](https://www.tmt.org/), [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/), and [WFIRST](https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

I love traveling, backpacking, hiking, swimming, watching old movies, learning and teaching math, physics, astronomy, statistical learning, scientific visualization, and almost anything related to coding!
