My name is Abtin Shahidi and I am a PhD student in Observational extragalactic astrophysics. My focus is on finding galaxies with very old stellar population at relatively high redshifts ($z>3$) in very large and multiwavelenght photometric catalogs. I am currently working on the CANDELS and COSMOS multiwavelenght catalogs to extract and infer their physical properties including their age and their star-formation rate. I am also a teaching assistance for various courses in both physics and engineering at the [University of California, Riverside (UCR)](https://www.ucr.edu/). (For more information about type of research in the Astronomy group at UCR, visit the [Astronomy Group at UCR](https://pages.github.com)

I love traveling, backpacking, swimming, and coding!

Any code related material could also be found in [my github page](https://github.com/abtinshahidi)
