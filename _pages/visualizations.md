## Visualization of semi-analytical models color catalogs

Using the Santa Cruz semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution, and its color catalogs produced to replicate the observed CANDELS fields, we reduce the dimensionality of the color space using multiple algorithms:

1. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection: [UMAP paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426)

2. t-Student Stochastic Neighbors Embedding: [t-SNE paper](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf)

3. Supervised Principal Component Analysis: [S-PCA paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320310005819)


For running an application for visualization of the training data, using different hyper-parameters:
